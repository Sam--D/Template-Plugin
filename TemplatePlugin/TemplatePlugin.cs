/*
 * 
 * Welcome to this template plugin.
 * Level: All Levels
 * Purpose: To get a working model for new plugins to be built off.  This plugin will
 * compile immediately, all you have to do is rename TemplatePlugin to reflect 
 * the purpose of the plugin.
 * 
 * You may need to delete the references to TerrariaServer and TShockAPI.  They 
 * could be pointing to my current folder.  Just remove them and then right-click the
 * references folder, go to browse go to the dll folder, and select both.
